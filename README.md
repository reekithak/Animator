# Animator

## Implementation for animator modules:
- Point to Note: <br> 
All these images generated by GAN have a common pattern. Every face's eyes lies in the same coordinates.
- Working of GANS: <br>
Generative as the name suggests tries to generate fake images that look like real images. It learns the features of X. The generator takes (random features) as input noise.<br>
The discriminator is a binary classifier and tries to discriminate the real images and the images created by the generator. It learns the probability of class Y (real or fake) given features X. The probabilities are the feedback for the generator.<br>

- In Short: <br>
Generator learns to make fakes that look real. Discriminator learns to distinguish real from fake.


## Steps in Training GAN's:
- Define Generator and Discriminator
- Train Generator to generate fake data for the discriminator
- Train Discriminator to differentiate real vs fake data
- Continue => Train => Save

## Flow of GAN:<br>  
Noise → Generator → Features → Discriminator → Output → Cost (output)<br>
